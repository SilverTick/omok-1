# omok
This board game is based off of the Maplestory omok game and uses Maplestory sprites from jBarna/omok.

A demo of the game can be viewed [here](https://jtquach1.github.io/omok/Online_Build).

I used C# (similar to Java) to interface with Unity. My original C# code, Board.cs, BoardManager.cs, and BoardSelector.cs, can be found under Assets.   

## Future Plans
* Develop [house rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku#Optional_("house")_rules). 
* Change the font and rest of the GUI to resemble Maplestory's
